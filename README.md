- A database running (e.g. MongoDB, Postgres)  
- (Optional) An account for cloud storage if you use S3, Cloudinary etc.

### Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Xabhi0811/RentalEase.git](https://github.com/Xabhi0811/RentalEase-2
   cd RentalEase
Install dependencies

bash
Copy code
# For backend
cd Backend
npm install
# For frontend
cd ../Frontend
npm install
Set up environment variables
Create .env files (in backend and frontend) with necessary keys, e.g.:

ini
Copy code
# Backend .env
PORT=5000
DB_URI=<your_database_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=…
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=…
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=…
ini
Copy code
# Frontend .env (if needed)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
Run the application
In separate terminals:

bash
Copy code
# Backend
cd Backend
npm start
bash
Copy code
# Frontend
cd Frontend
npm start
The frontend should now run (e.g. on http://localhost:3000) and backend on http://localhost:5000.

Usage
As a property owner: signup/login → add property listing → upload images/amenities → manage listings → view messages from prospective renters.

As a renter: browse/search listings → filter results → view property details → contact owner or schedule a visit → finalize rental.

You can extend features to include reviews, payments, lease agreements, etc.
